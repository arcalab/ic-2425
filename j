areas of biology; this includes analysis of contagious disease propagation and the development
of personalised treatments against cancer. Accomplishing the project’s goal of establishing Conrm
that it is
contagious foundations for cyber-physical programming, together with tools for analysis and verication,
will therefore contribute to these areas and more specically to the un sdg nº3.
Cyber-physical systems are more and more present in human-made infrastructure, both
in cities and industry. If such structures are to be safe and resilient then they must be based
4
on a disciplined, mathematical way of developing cyber-physical systems, which is precisely
the project’s overarching goal. e project will therefore contribute to the un sdg nº11.
Smart grids and vehicular networks are prime examples of where the cyber-physical domain
takes an important role in a ecient use of natural resources. Smart grids, for example,
dynamically adapt to dierent meteorological conditions (e.g. windy or sunny days . . . ) in
order to distribute energy more eciently. Equally, vehicular networks improve the distribution
of vehicles on roads (thus avoiding trac congestions), dynamically form convoys in
order to minimise drag, and generally reduce the cost of public transportation. erefore, this
project and its focus on case studies concerning vehicular networks contribute to the un sdg
nº12.As already mentioned, models of cyber-physical system are already being used across dierent
